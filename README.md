Hi, I'm Luca Gurgenidze. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Asset Management at Yale University, set to graduate in May 2025.
I have a background in quantitative chemistry, with a research specialization in nanoparticle growth kinetics.
I am searching for roles in quant trading / research, and am actively applying to programs for the upcoming year (2025).
